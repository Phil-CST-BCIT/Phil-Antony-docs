### Scenario Example

Let's imagine you work as an office clerk at Walmart's whole sales department. Your company is responsible to distribute a hundred thousand items from warehouses to all stores across North America. Your company needs some data to know the sales trend for each item.

One of your daily tasks is to write a summary to your boss. However, the Excel sheet you received from coworkers has one hundred thousand rows, and each row has twenty columns. Your boss told you only a few columns are needed in the report. The following table(Click to see in a new tab) shows the difficulty level of the repeated task.

Let's suppose you are going to select columns *OrderDate*, *Region*, *Item*, *Units*, *UnitCosts*, and *Total* from the original sheet. You will need to make new Excel files sorted by the *Region* column.

### Basic Data Types

Excel works with data, and the data could be numbers such as 1, 2, 3, or a word like hello. The numbers 1, 2, 3 in Python are called **_Numeric Type_**.The word "hello" refers to Data Type **_String_**.
You can't add a **_Numeric Type_** with a **_String_**.
