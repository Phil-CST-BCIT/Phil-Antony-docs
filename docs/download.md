### Downloading Libaries

<hr>
A Python library is a set of programs written by experienced programmers. The library provides some predefined functionalities and lets you focus on your task without thinking of how to write code to build those functionalities. In other words, a library is some code you can instantly use in your program.

We need to download three libraries for our project, and they are
- [pandas](https://phil-cst-bcit.github.io/Phil-Antony-docs/docs/glossary/)
- [xlrd](https://phil-cst-bcit.github.io/Phil-Antony-docs/docs/glossary/)
- [openpyxl](https://phil-cst-bcit.github.io/Phil-Antony-docs/docs/glossary/)
<hr>

First of all, we need to use a tool called **_Terminal_**

![](https://github.com/Phil-CST-BCIT/Phil-Antony-docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/note.png?raw=true "note")

- Open Terminal
   1. Click launchpad

   2. Click Other
   ![](https://github.com/Phil-CST-BCIT/Phil-Antony-docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/launchpad.png?raw=true "launchpad")

   3. Click Terminal
   ![](https://github.com/Phil-CST-BCIT/Phil-Antony-docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/terminal.png?raw=true "launchpad")
<hr>

Now, let's check if you have installed **_Python3_** on you computer<br/>

- Change directory to your **_working directory_**<br/>

`cd /absolute_path_to/your_working_directory/`

- Type the following command in your terminal<br/>

`which python3`

   * If the computer tells you the following, then you have **_Python 3_** installed on your computer.<br/>

   `/usr/local/bin/python3`

   * If it tells you<br/>

   `Python3 not found:`<br/>

   It means you don't have **_Python 3_** installed on your computer.<br/>
   Go to [Step 1](https://phil-cst-bcit.github.io/Phil-Antony-docs/docs/install/) to install **_Python 3_**.
<hr>

And then, we can start to download the libraries.<br/>

We'll use a program **_PIP3_** to install libraries.

- Install **_Pandas_**. Type in the following command in terminal<br/>

`pip3 install pandas`<br/>

![](https://github.com/Phil-CST-BCIT/Phil-Antony-docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/install_pandas.png?raw=true)

- Install **_xlrd_**.<br/>

`pip3 install xlrd`<br/>

- Install **_openpyxl_**<br/>

`pip3 install openpyxl`

Next, let's write our first Python code. [Jump to Write Code](https://phil-cst-bcit.github.io/Phil-Antony-docs/docs/write_code/)
