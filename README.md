To readers,

This instruction is called "How to Automate Excel files using Python". The main purpose of the instruction is to minimize the human work when dealing with long Excel files and to enhance the accuracy of each calculation. Out of all programming languages, Python is the most simple to use for people who are both technical and non-technical; therefore, we will give you a Python code and all you need to do is writing that down in your own computer. To do that, you will be needing our instruction.

Our instruction will be divided into 4 tasks:

1. Install Python and Pycharm 
2. Configure Pycharm
3. Download libraries
4. Write code

If you have any question, you reach out to us by **minhpham10b@gmail.com"**. We hope you will find this instruction useful!

Sincerely,

Antony and Phil
